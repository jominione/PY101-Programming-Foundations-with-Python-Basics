# Let's do some "ASCII Art": a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back
# in the days before computers had video screens.
#
# For this practice problem, write a program that outputs 
# 'The Flintsones Rock!' 10 times, with each line prefixed by one more
# hyphen than the line above it. The output should start out like this:
# -The Flintstones Rock!
# --THe Flintstones Rock!
#    ...

string = "The Flintstones Rock!"
for _ in range(10):
    string = "-" + string
    print(string)

for padding in range(1, 11):
    print(f'{"-" * padding}The Flintstones Rock!')
