# Will the code below raise an error?

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[6] = 5

# Yes. The variable numbers is a non-empty list of three elements.
# By trying to access the 6th index of numbers list you are trying to access an
# index that does not exist. This will raise an 
# IndexError: 'list index out of range' exception.
