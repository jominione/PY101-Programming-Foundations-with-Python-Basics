# What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced
# in the last line of the code below?

if False:
    greeting = "hello world"

print(greeting)

# Solution: The expression containing greeting variable is not executed 
# hence is not assigned value. This means when print is invoked greeting
# is not defined and will raise a NameError.
