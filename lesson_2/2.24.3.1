# What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have
# tried to answer.

# Example:

num = 5

def my_func():
    print(num)

my_func()

# Solution: Since num is not defined in the function, Python will look for
# num in its lexical scope which in this case is the global scope. When my_func
# is called it will output 5.

# Official Solution: This prints 5. The variable num initialised to 5 on line
# 1 is accessible within the scope of the my_func function. When that function
# is invoked, 5 is printed.
