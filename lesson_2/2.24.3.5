# What will the following code do? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

# Example:

def my_func():
    num = 10

my_func
print(num)

# Solution: Raise NameError: num is not defined. num is defined within my_func
# function but is not accessible outside of this function. So when print is
# invoked num is not initialised and will rase an NameError.

# Official solution: This code raises a NameError since the variable num is
# defined within the function my_func and is not accessible outside of its
# scope.
