# What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have
# tried to answer.

# Example:

def outer():
    outer_var = 'Hello'

    def inner():
        inner_var = 'World'
        print(outer_var, inner_var)

    inner()

outer()

# Solution: Print 'Hello World'. When outer is invoked, it invokes inner
# function. The inner function calls on both out_var and inner_var which
# are defined within the local scope of outer and inner functions.

# Official solution: This prints 'Hello World'. The outer() function defines
# a local variable outer_var witht he value 'Hello'. Inside it, the inner()
# function is defined, which has its own local variable inner_var with the
# value 'World'. When inner() is called within outer(), but outer_var and
# inner_var are printed using print(outer_var, inner_var), which outputs 'Hello
# World'.
